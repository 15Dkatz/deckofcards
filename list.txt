Kori, my name is Chase Roberts.

First, the email link at the bottom of the landing page has kori@mymentor.io. I'm guessing you wanted to update that to sherbert.io

I have some questions about sherbert. I just found you because I waste too much time on twitter. But I am very curious about if you have done any marketing or prelaunch type stuff to get signups? 

Second, have you raised any money?

Last, I have recently started a prelaunch discovery website called betacrunch. The idea behind betacrunch.com is that users can basically rate each product as something they would use or not and just give a little feedback. Wondering if that is something that may interest you? It's still uber new, we only have about 200 users right now, so we won't overwhelm your server or anything.

I don't really understand what sherbert is besides that I think you guys are building a mobile app and are in the education space. Could you explain it to me a little better? If it's something we like, how would you feel about us featuring it?

Thanks,
Chase

Nova,
Hey, my name is Chase, I saw the sideclick on kickstarter. You guys are killing it. I'm wondering what kind of things you all did to prepare for your prelaunch. I am just super curious about what people do before they launch a kickstarter campaign.

I've been interested in the prelaunch/beta space lately. I helped a friend build a site called gitviral.com, which basically is a super simple email referral campaign, and I started a startup discovery site called BetaCrunch.com to help people get early feedback. Anyway, I am just curious what people do to get early traction.

Thanks,
I also looked through the Nova Blog a little bit and I am getting the picture that you guys are actually a collection a companies? I would love to be the first to feature any other upcoming products on betacrunch if you're interested. Keep up the good work.

-Chase

Hey, 
We have put together a site for providing a bit of feedback and early discovery for startups, called betacrunch.com. Since you're in the space, I thought you may be interested. It's a great way to support fellow entrepreneurs and see what's new. That's all.

-Chase
